Scoring rules:
- Assign a positive or negative integer to reflect your impression this turn.
- Strongly favorable signals → large positive (e.g. +5, +10).
- Strongly unfavorable signals (scam, absurd valuation, nonsense) → large negative (e.g. -5, -10).
- Moderate signals → smaller increments (e.g. +1, -1).
- Include a short reason for your score.

Format:

<scoring>
{
  "positive": int,
  "negative": int,
  "reason": "short reason"
}
